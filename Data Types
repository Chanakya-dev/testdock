Integer type –
An integer type stores an integer number with no fractional or decimal places. Java has four integer types – byte, short, int, and long.

Byte
The byte is the smallest data type among all the integer data types. It is an 8-bit signed two’s complement integer. It stores whole numbers ranging from -128 to 127.

Syntax:
byte byteVariable;

Short
Short is a 16-bit signed two’s complement integer. It stores whole numbers with values ranging from -32768 to 32767. Its default value is 0.
Syntax:
short shortVariable;

Int
Int is a 32-bit signed two’s complement integer that stores integral values ranging from 2147483648 (-2^31) to 2147483647 (2^31 -1). Its default value is 0.
Syntax:
int intVariable;

Long 
long is a 64-bit signed two’s complement integer that stores values ranging from -9223372036854775808(-2^63) to 9223372036854775807(2^63 -1). It is used when we need a range of values more than those provided by int. Its default value is 0L. This data type ends with ‘L’ or ‘l’.
Float
stores fractional numbers ranging from 3.4e-038 to 3.4e+038
Double 
The double data type is similar to float. The difference between the two is that is double twice the float in the case of decimal precision. It is used for decimal values just like float and should not be used for precise values.

A double value:
is a double-precision 64-bit or 8 bytes IEEE 754 floating-point
can have a 15-digit decimal precision

DataType	 Default Value	Default size	  Range
byte	         0	      1 byte or 8 bits  -128 to 127
short	         0	     2 bytes or 16 bits	  -32,768 to 32,767
int	           0	     4 bytes or 32 bits	 2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long	         0	     8 bytes or 64 bits	   9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float	        0.0f	   4 bytes or 32 bits	   1.4e-045 to 3.4e+038
double        0.0d	   8 bytes or 64 bits	   4.9e-324 to 1.8e+308
char       ‘\u0000’	   2 bytes or 16 bits    0 to 65536
boolean       FALSE	   1 byte or 2 bytes	   0 or 1
